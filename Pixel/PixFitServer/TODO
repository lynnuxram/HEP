TODO for FitFarm
================

********
Features
********

General:
- add a flag to tell Controller that FitServer is ready to receive data (luckily, this has just magically worked up to now)
- clean abort scan option (e.g. if scanid or pixel mismatch, reset network, clean buffers ...)
- complain about missing .root file for slave emulator mode

PixFitInstanceConfig:
- get full ROD/fitfarm configuration from db (already started in RC5 pit branch but not tested)

PixFitAssembler: 
- fix ToT sigma (and figure out how to compute a sensible ToT sigma in SHORT_TOT)
